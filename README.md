### FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT

# Challenge Project: Appointment Planner

# Overview

Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

# Project Goals

In this project, you will use functional React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments.

You will work with stateful and stateless functional React components using hooks. The requirements section will walk through implementing the app from the topmost component down. If you would like to implement it in a different order, feel free to do what is comfortable for you.

# Setup Instructions

If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy, you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button below. You’ll need to open and work in **main.js** in a text editor. To edit **main.js**, use your text editor of choice. If you need a recommendation or help to install an editor, we recommend looking into our [article about setting up a text editor for web development](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/visual-studio-code) (Follow along until you get to the section: “Practice: Let’s Make a Project”). To run **main.js** on your computer, you will need to install Node.js. If you need help installing Node.js, read our [article on installing Node](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/setting-up-node-locally).
